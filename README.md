# PokedexVGG
The code implemented here has been based on the tutorials distributed by https://www.pyimagesearch.com
The Code found in the Pokedex Dataset notebook generates an imagedataset using the bing search api. The process must be finished by hand 
cleaning the possible images that could have been added to wrong labels. 

A small sample of the images generated by the api has been included in this git.

Also, the notebook could print some Error messages in case that the image is not downloaded correctly, take this as a warning message, still the process will finish.

PokeKerasV1 notebook contains the whole image treating process as well as the model structure, initialization and training and an example with a charmander picture.
